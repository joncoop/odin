  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Odin is intended to be a simple, easy-to-understand, and bloat-free framework used to quickly create complex, fully-responsive layouts and to develop a feel for how more full-featured frameworks are used. Because of this frameworks simplicity, markup should generally require a minimum of classes and thus maintain readability. This framework is meant to be educational as much as it is useful. Go ahead and look at the source. Hopefully, the simplified code will give some insight as to how many of the major frameworks (Bootstrap, Skeleton, Materialize, Pure, and so on) work.</p>

  <p>The grid is based entirely on flexbox and there are no browser prefixes or CSS 'hacks' used. Also, no effort has been made to ensure backwards-compatiblity with older browsers. Still, it will probably work fine with the latest versions of any major browser. (So if compatability with IE9 or earlier is important, then this might not be the framework for you.)</p>

  <p>You will also notice that many components associated with other frameworks such as carousels, cards, collapsible menus, navigation elements, form styling, etc. are not included. Perhaps at some point, more CSS modules will be added to implement extra features. Or maybe not. If extra functionality is needed, there are plenty of third-party CSS/JS options out there that should be pretty easy to integrate into this framework.</p>

  <p>So why is it called Odin? The framework is based on 12 columns, so I looked at the Wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_(number)">12</a> and saw the entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Odin</a>. He seems like a pretty cool guy to name a framework after. Plus he has a pretty epic beard. So here we are.</p>
