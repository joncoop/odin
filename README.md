## To do

### for v1.0
- 0.8.0 Add more typography styling, work on the "vertical rhythm"
- 0.9.0 Add button styling
- 0.9.1 Use some flex magic to avoid using padding for gutters (hopefully)
- 0.9.2 Fix Firefox navbar quirks
- 0.9.3 Remove JQuery dependency
- 0.9.4 General code cleanup, clean up color palette, minor styling tweaks
- 0.9.5 Document the CSS really nicely
- 1.0.0 Release unminimized in src folder, minimized in dist

### for 1.0+
- 1.1.0 Add containers that snap to widths according to viewport
- 1.2.0 Add 'sticky' features for header and footer elements
- 1.3.0 Create row-10 class and corresponding col classes to have rows based on 10ths. (Or take advantage of flex for autosizing column classes.)

## more ideas (not to include in css/js, just write instructions)
- Icon fonts
- Image carousels (owl-carousel)
- Add default code styling, syntax highlighting

## for fun
- Make the docs much prettier
