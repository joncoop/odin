- 0.9.5 - General code cleanup, clean up color palette, minor styling tweaks.
- 0.9.6 - Document the CSS really nicely.
- 1.0.0 - Bug fixes and release.

### for 1.0+
- 1.1.0 - Add containers that snap to widths according to viewport.
- 1.2.0 - Add 'sticky' features for header and footer elements.
- 1.3.0 - Create row-10 class and corresponding col classes to have rows based on 10ths. (Or take advantage of flex for autosizing column classes.)
